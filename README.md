# ajarana.github.io

This portfolio website was developed and designed by Andres Arana. Its graphic design and frontend architecture are currently being redesigned.

You can view the current production build at [ajarana.github.io](https://ajarana.github.io/).

Please note that the following components, pages, and styles are in the process of being refactored:

- header
- footer
- resume
- blog
- home
- Sass partials

**If** the need arises, I plan to use [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for application-level state management and [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to manage the state for a group of components.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Run the Development Server

```shell
npm start
```

Create React App's development server has [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) configured and enabled by default.

### Run Unit Tests

```shell
npm test
```

### Generate a Production Build

```shell
npm run build
```

The production build gets placed in the generated `build` folder.
