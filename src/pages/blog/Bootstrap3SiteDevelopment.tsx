            using Boostrap 3 components, LESS, HTML5, and a little bit of
            JavaScript. Bootstrap takes care of a lot of things for you: the
            design, media queries, modular classes, meta tags, and UI
            transitions and animations. Customization requires a little more
            knowledge, but otherwise it is a very easy framework to work with.

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            Bootstrap is an extremely useful framework for when you need to
            build a responsive front-end both quickly and easily. It will
            require much more work to actually learn about the specific
            technologies they use, but it is still worthwhile to spend your time
            learning Bootstrap.
