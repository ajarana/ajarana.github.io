						was built using ReactJS and Redux. I also used plain, old CSS3 for
						the layout and icons. I didn't bother generating the header or
						footer with React, however, because it's a static component I use
						across my entire website.
					</p>

					<h2>React</h2>
					<p>
						As I mentioned before, everything besides the header and footer are
						rendered with ReactJS. I separated the layout between{" "}

						>
							presentational and container components
						</a>{" "}
						in order to separate elements that serve as sources of data versus
						those that are simply passed data to present.
					</p>
					<p>
						This also served as a great introduction to{" "}

						>
							ES6
						</a>
						. My components included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a

								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"

								<strong>Progress Bar</strong>
							</a>{" "}

					</ul>
					<h2>Redux</h2>
					<p>
						<a
							href="http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/DataFlow.html"

							Redux
						</a>{" "}
						was used for state management; it was really annoying to have to
						pass data through a bunch of componenets just so the last one in the
						chain could have access to some data. Redux stores the entire state
						of the application in one object so that you can access it at any
						given point in time.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my project, Ajax calls are made via the Fetch API depending on
						the currently selected category. The returned data is stored in one
						object. Components like Progress Bar can then directly access the
						data to give an accurate representation of how much data has been
						downloaded at any given point in time through the Ajax calls.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another presentational component, Picker, also receives data from my
						Filter container component in order to change its styling according
						to the selected category.
					</p>
					<h2>CSS3</h2>
					<p>
						The styling was very straightforward for this project. The trickiest
						part was making sure components were rendered with the{" "}
						<a
							href="https://github.com/ajarana/arcade/blob/master/src/components/Picker.js#L9"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>
							correct CSS class
						</a>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						CSS3 transitions work wonderfully even when React has to re-render a
						component.
					</p>
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p>
						I really enjoyed getting to know the basics of React and Redux here.
						Although I used the JSX preprocessor for React, I was also able to
						use vanilla JS directly alongside it and continue learning its
						nuances.
